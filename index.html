        <h2> <u>Sake Toro from Umami Japanese Bistro</u></h2>
          <p> I might be biased because I work there, but this appetizer is so good.</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Although, this dish can be rather pricy it is worth it.</li>
             <li>Sake Toro means "salmon belly", which is the more tender part of the fish.</li>
             <li>The sauce on it is a korean sweet and spicy vinegrette, which is what makes the dish so good.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2> <u>Curry from Thai Pepper</u></h2>
          <p> In my opinion, Thai Pepper has the best curry in Baton Rouge.</p>
            <ul>
             <li>I usually order the red curry with chicken, I think this image is of yellow curry.</li>
             <li>Thai spice is on another level so if you enjoy hot foods, you should try it.</li>
             <li>Thai pepper also has really good desserts, seasonally they'll have mango sticky rice and its definitely one of my favorites.</li>

        <h2> <u>Ube ice cream & Taiyaki from Sweet Society</u></h2>
          <p> Baton Rouge is definitely lacking in dessert spots, but Sweet Society is a nice little spot.</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Sweet Society has a very cute aesthetic inside and it is attached to Boru, which is a ramen place.</li>
             <li>Their menu has a good variety with seasonal ice cream flavors, taiyaki, boba and bingsu.</li>
             <li>It's location is a bit strange though, in the Electric Depot off of Government, but theres some good spots off of Government.</li>
